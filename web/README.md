# Registration System

A React-based user registration form built as an internship assignment. This project uses pure React (Hooks), plain CSS, and custom validation logic without external UI libraries.

## Features

- **Centralized Validation**: All rules are managed in a single `validate()` function.
- **Form Handling**: Controlled components using `useState`.
- **Custom Age Logic**: Precisely calculates age based on year, month, and day to ensure 18+ requirement.
- **Password Security Checks**: Enforces complexity (Upper, Lower, Number) and minimum length.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean layout using standard CSS Flexbox.
